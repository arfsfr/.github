## Hello from the Arfur team!

[![WPILib-rs!](/profile/banner.svg)](https://github.com/wpilib-rs)

At Arfur, we love Rust and FRC. We want to combine the two, using open source methods and research ideas, to improve software quality and reliablity *in our robots* ðŸ¤–. We are big on safe and composable software: functional, typed, immutable. We develop a variety of software, from [systems-level bindings](https://github.com/arfsr/arfsfr) to [higher-level mathematical abstractions](https://github.com/arfsfr/frames).

We're open to contributors, so if you want to shape the future of the software industry working with innovative teammates, [join us](https://github.com/arfsfr/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)!
